The coursework archive contains the following files and directories:

- build.xml : ant build script - it will build an executable jar, with BCEL
library included, with the command "jar"

- src : contains the skeleton source code
- build : where ant stores the compiled classes
- jars : where ant stores the executable jar
- testfiles : contains a public test file with redundant gotos. The Example.class
is actually built from Example.j which is jasmin source code.
- lib : contains bcel 5.2 library jar.
- doc : should contain your report in either PDF or Word format.

Work within this directory structure, and make sure that everything can be built
using the ant script before submitting a single zip file that contains all the
directories.
